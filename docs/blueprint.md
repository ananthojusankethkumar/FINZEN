## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated turquoise (#73E2A8) for a calming and trustworthy feel, reflecting the 'Zen' aspect of the app. A less saturated tone ensures a focus on clarity, not distraction.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0FAF4), almost white. Its low saturation keeps it professional, while the hint of green keeps it harmonious with the turquoise primary.
- Accent color: Soft gold (#E5C47D) to highlight key actions and financial insights. Gold invokes the reliability of value, without the harshness of a more urgent tone such as red.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, to make both body text and headings readable and friendly.
- Simple line icons in the primary turquoise color. Icons should be clean and represent the different types of financial actions or insights.
- Clean and minimalist design to avoid overwhelming users with financial information. Ample use of white space.
- Subtle transitions for data updates and goal achievements to provide positive reinforcement without being distracting.
